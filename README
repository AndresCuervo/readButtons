# A script for allowing screen readers access to buttons

Install bookmarklet script with `npm install -g bookmarklet`,
and compile with `bookmarklet readButtons.js out.js`

## TODO:

[] Add [`gulp-bookmarklet `](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-bookmarklet) as
a way to automate this! Do it with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)?
